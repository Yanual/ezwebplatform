This trunk directory is self-content and it's not necessary 
any installation process. 

However, EzWeb platform relies on Django-rest-interface library 
and it's needed to apply a patch to one file (resource.py) in
order to get all working properly.

The install.py script, applies the changes to the resource.py
file.

IN ORDER TO GET EZWEB WORKING, IT'S MANDADORY TO EXECUTE install.py
SCRIPT JUST AFTER CHECK-OUT.
